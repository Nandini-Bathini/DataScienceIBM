# Applied Data Science Capstone  
Course 10 of 12 in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate  

---

## About This Course  
This capstone project serves as the final course in both the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate** and the **Applied Data Science with Python Specialization**. It provides hands-on experience simulating real-world data science tasks.  

In this course, you will take on the role of a **Data Scientist** for a startup aiming to compete with SpaceX. You will follow the **Data Science methodology**, including:  
- Data Collection  
- Data Wrangling  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Data Visualization  
- Model Development  
- Model Evaluation  
- Reporting insights to stakeholders  

Your main objective will be to predict whether the **first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket** will land successfully. These predictions will enable the competing startup to make **more informed bids against SpaceX** for future rocket launches.  

This course focuses primarily on applying your **data science and machine learning skills** rather than introducing new concepts. Upon successful completion, you will have a valuable project to showcase in your **portfolio**.
