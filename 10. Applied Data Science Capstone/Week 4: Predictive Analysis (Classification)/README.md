# Predictive Analysis (Classification)  

> In this module, you will apply machine learning techniques to predict whether the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. You will split the dataset into **training and test sets**, fine-tune **Hyperparameters** for models such as **Support Vector Machines (SVM), Classification Trees, and Logistic Regression**, and evaluate the best-performing method using test data.
