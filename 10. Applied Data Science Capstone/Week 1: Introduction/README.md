# Introduction  

> In this capstone project, we aim to **predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully**. SpaceX offers Falcon 9 rocket launches at **$62 million**, whereas competitors charge upwards of **$165 million**. The significant cost savings stem from **SpaceXâ€™s ability to reuse the first stage**. By predicting first-stage landings, we can estimate **launch costs**, which can be useful for other companies looking to compete against SpaceX for rocket launch contracts.  

> This module provides an **overview of the problem, datasets, and tools** necessary to complete the course.
